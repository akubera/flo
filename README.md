A naive and amateurish attempt at an event stream server in rust.

## Todo:

[X] parse events as JSON
[X] persist events
[ ] consumers start reading events at a specified point
[ ] logging
[ ] remove consumers after connections are closed
[ ] Persist event index
[ ] rebuild indexes
[ ] event filtering
